title: AMM Pools
---

HydraDX and its sister chain Basilisk will implement various Automated Market Maker (AMM) models.

We are currently working on the following AMM pools:

### XYK

Uniswap-like AMM model. We have implemented this pool as it is already known, so it would be possible to test it with our exchange implementation.

### HDX

HydraDX Omnipool implementation.

### LBP

Balancer-like Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP). TBD.
